Project Report
It is very important that you clearly and specifically state in your project report what you
have accomplished by the end of the semester. Be concise. I do not want to see code
listings (except maybe pseudo-codes of algorithms to demonstrate a point). Your project
report should be well organized and contain the following information, though the format
and organization is totally up to you:
• Your Team Member’s Name and project Title
• Problem summary – Briefly summarize the problem you are dealing with and why
it is important. This is likely to be a modification of your proposal.
• Description of work – Describe the work you performed. Include any major
“dead end” paths of research and why they failed, and any major challenges you
encountered.
• Results – Describe exactly what was achieved. State exactly what you have
accomplished, giving concrete information (e.g. by charts, pictures, screenshots,
videos, etc.) about what you have done, including some screenshots or videos of
the results in your program. If you have a video of your results, please place the
video on Youtube and include the video link in the report.
• Analysis of work – You should analyze the work done from the standpoint of how
successful you were on the project. You should include the following information:
How well did you meet the original goals you set out? If you did not meet these
goals, why not?
