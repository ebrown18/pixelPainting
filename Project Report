Project Report
It is very important that you clearly and specifically state in your project report what you
have accomplished by the end of the semester. Be concise. I do not want to see code
listings (except maybe pseudo-codes of algorithms to demonstrate a point). Your project
report should be well organized and contain the following information, though the format
and organization is totally up to you:


Name: Elliana Brown
Project Title: Palette to Pixel

Problem Summary: The project aims to tackle the challenge of generating realistic landscapes using computer graphics by drawing inspiration from 
the iconic techniques of the great American landscape painter, Bob Ross. This should ultimately result in the advancement of my 
understanding of algorithms and techniques that can recreate his distinctive brushwork, color harmonies, and composition 
principles within the digital realm. In doing so, I hope to help advance the field of landscape generation, bridging the gap 
between traditional artistry and cutting-edge computer graphics, ultimately creating environments that evoke the same sense of 
tranquility and natural beauty as found in Ross's renowned works. This endeavor is important/interesting for several reasons. For one, it offers an opportunity to delve into the intersection of 
traditional art and cutting-edge technology, showcasing the potential of computer graphics in artistic endeavors. Secondly, it 
will provide valuable insight into the art of rendering landscapes – a necessary skill for nearly every computer graphics 
professional. Finally, this project has the potential to incorporate many skills from the field of computer graphics, especially 
when considering the more minute details like brushstrokes. Compiling all these detailed elements into one piece is sure to be 
interesting. The project will involve digitally recreating at least one Bob Ross painting using graphics software/tools. To do this, I will 
analyze and deconstruct Ross’s techniques – especially in regard to brushstroke patterns, color harmonies, and spatial 
arrangement. Then, I will implement algorithms and procedural generation methods to simulate natural elements i.e., trees, 
mountains, bodies of water, etc. that mirror those in the works of Bob Ross until I have a finished piece.

Description of Work:

• Description of work – Describe the work you performed. Include any major
“dead end” paths of research and why they failed, and any major challenges you
encountered.
• Results – Describe exactly what was achieved. State exactly what you have
accomplished, giving concrete information (e.g. by charts, pictures, screenshots,
videos, etc.) about what you have done, including some screenshots or videos of
the results in your program. If you have a video of your results, please place the
video on Youtube and include the video link in the report.
• Analysis of work – You should analyze the work done from the standpoint of how
successful you were on the project. You should include the following information:
How well did you meet the original goals you set out? If you did not meet these
goals, why not?
